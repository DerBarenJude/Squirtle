Squirtle
========

HackJam @Berkeley - Chrome Extension 

Squirtle allows you to save and reload any entered text on your current page. It will repopulate your fields with your previously entere text.
Squirtle also remembers your scroll position and high lighted text, so when you reload a page, any text will be highlighted with RegEX.

You can also generate a link with the saved information, share it, and someone opening it with Squirtle will be scrolled to where you left off (your entered text included!)
