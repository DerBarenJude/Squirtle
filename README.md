#Squirtle

### Features
Squirtle allows you to save and reload any entered text on your current page. It will repopulate your fields with your previously entered text.

Squirtle also remembers your scroll position and highlighted text

You can also generate a link with the saved information, share it, and someone opening it with Squirtle will be scrolled to where you left off (your entered text included!)
